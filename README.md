# imbACE - Coding for Science - Advanced Console Environment

imbACE (Advanced Console Environment) is an application framework for rapid development of scientific/experimentation command-line and console UI tools (including Text User Interface). The main goal of the project is to provide libraries with High Level API focused on: reporting & self-documenting, scripting & automation, modular (plugin) development, client/server architecture, data & objects serialization and other useful staff. It is meant for scientists and PhD students performing research in IT/Computing related fields, but not the ones from the Computing Sciences - as they usually have their own tools/libraries/frameworks. The main motivation for the imbACE is to help you with the “research environment setup”, in scenario where you need a custom-made toolkit to perform your research objective(s).

imbACE is the second open source project of imbVeles Framework.
